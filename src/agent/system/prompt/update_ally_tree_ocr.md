### Instructions:
- You are provided with:
  1. **A screenshot** of a user interface.
  2. **An accessibility tree (A11y Tree)** corresponding to that screenshot, structured hierarchically, segmented by window or application.
  3. **OCR scan results** from the screenshot, containing textual information for elements not present in the accessibility tree.

- Your task is to:
  - Understand the elements visible in the screenshot.
  - Compare the **A11y Tree** with the **OCR results** to identify UI elements (especially text elements) visible in the screenshot but missing in the **A11y Tree**.
  - Accurately **integrate the missing elements** from the OCR results into their appropriate locations in the **A11y Tree** based on the visual structure of the screenshot.
  - Ensure the hierarchical structure of the **A11y Tree** is preserved, maintaining the correct **parent-child relationships** for elements.
  
NOTE: The final output should be the **updated A11y Tree**, containing all relevant elements seen in the screenshot and should be free from reductancy of same elements. Lastly, respond in plain text.
